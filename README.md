# espTouchSwiftUIExample

## Background
For those of you that use the esp32 in your hardware projects, this is an example IOS SwiftUI project that configures the WiFi using the SmartConfig / ESP-Touch approach ([ESP-Touch](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-touch/overview)).

If you use the Arduino IDE to program your esp32, then there already exists a sample sketch that should help getting this working for you ([WiFiSmartConfig](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libraries/WiFi/examples/WiFiSmartConfig/WiFiSmartConfig.ino)).

Espressif have an example app on the app store along with the base code available on github and as a CocoaPod.

This version was tested and working against IOS 14.0.
